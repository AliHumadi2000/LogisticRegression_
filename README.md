# LogisticRegression_
## The Logistic Regression is a regression model in which the response variable (dependent variable) has categorical values such as True/False or 0/1. It actually measures the probability of a binary response as the value of response variable based on the mathematical equation relating it with the predictor variables.

## The general mathematical equation for logistic regression is âˆ’

## y = 1/(1+e^-(a+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3+...))
## Output variable -> y
## y -> Whether the client has subscribed a term deposit or not 
## Binomial ("yes" or "no")
